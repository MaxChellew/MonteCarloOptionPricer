# MonteCarloOptionPricer

This project was a self-set project that looked into the implementation of a Monte Carlo method to price exotic options. The theoretical basis behind this program was to use Brownian motion to simulate the change in the underlying stock's price over time. Then multiple simulations of the stocks price could be mapped and the payoffs of an option could be calculated for each simulation. The payoffs for each simulation could then be averaged and discounted to give the value of the option at time zero. Please find the C++ file in the repository to explore the exotic option pricer program."

## Objectives
Following is a list of objectives for this project:
- Create a short timeline of the FTXs collapse
- Perfrom a anaylsis of the colapse of FTX; touch on both classical and behavioural reasons
- Provided 3 challenges and regulatory priority to safeguard the orderly financial market that embraces crypto trading
- Word Limit (1500 &pm;25%)
	
## Key Takeaways
Following is a list of the knowledge I acquired from completing this project:
- Cryptocurrency & Cryptocurrency Exchange
- FTX & FTT
- The effect of different risk measurements (VaR and expected shortfall) for assets and liabilities
- Information efficiency & Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Utility theory
- Cognitive biases: availability bias, representative bias, herding bias
- Public sentiment
- Financial regulations
- Bitcoin's white paper
